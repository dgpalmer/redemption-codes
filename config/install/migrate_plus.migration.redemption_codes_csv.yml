  # Here we identify the columns of interest in the source file. Each numeric
  # key is the 0-based index of the column. For each column, the key below
  # (e.g., "start_date") is the field name assigned to the data on import, to
  # be used in field mappings below. The value is a user-friendly string for
  # display by the migration UI.

  # Most fields can be mapped directly - we just specify the destination (D8)
  # field and the corresponding field name from above, and the values will be
  # copied in.
